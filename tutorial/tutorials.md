# Rules

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting

- Before and after, pattern and replacement
- Same shapes, different colors
- Instances of pattern are found and replaced with replacement

# Topological matching

- Informally, topologically same if one can be deformed into the other.
  Examples!

Add colored padding around "before", "after"!

A rule has a before and an after side.

> Example picture with labels for before, after, touching between two regions

Both sides must have the same shapes but can have different colors.

Topological matches of the before side are replaced with the after side.



> Examples

Solid regions are matched rigidly, meaning the shape must match exactly.

> Examples

Wildcard regions can match regions of any colors.
