# Notation for pattern and matches

el_phi maps el in the pattern -> phi_el in the scene

pi_element stands for pattern_element
mu_element stands for matching_element

Why use pi_element instead of pattern_element and mu_element instead 
of matching_element?

mu_element is ambiguous than matching_element on purpose, it only makes
sense to name something a "matching element" if it has a corresponding 
element in a pattern, mu_element could also be something related to
a matching element.

Also simply because it is shorter and so easier to use consistently.
